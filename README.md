This was a platformer I was making in Ruby for a game jam.  It utilizes the Gosu gem.  I got about 600 lines in when I realized OCRA (the One Click Ruby Application Builder) had suddenly stopped working with my code, despite the scripts running fine on the interpreter.  I decided I'd rather not risk being unable to distribute my game, so I've begun making the game in C++ with SDL instead.  I figured this code may be of use to someone else, so I've released it under the GPL license.
